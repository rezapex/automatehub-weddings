In short, wedding planning is stressful and complex with many moving parts and many couples outsource a lot of the stuff to wedding planners, which are great, but essentially most of that work can be done by well crafted agents. I am creating a saas tool which will assist couples with various tasks involved in the wedding planning process. It will consist of "templates" or "workflows" or "Agents" from Venue Booking Agent, to Vow Generation Agent, to Budgeting Agents, etc. add these features or "agents" into /Users/minimalist/saas-template-main/components/features.tsx
